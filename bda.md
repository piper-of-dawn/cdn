As of 2025Q1, we lack specific Business Area Code assignments for CS Positions. This gap creates challenges as the downstream Aggreagtion model expects Business Area Code assignments for each position. In order to ensure consistency and maintain data integrity, we will implement a temporary workaround by mapping CS Positions to a fixed Business Area Code. This designated usiness Area Code will correspond to the most material Business Area within the respective Business Division.
