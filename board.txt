**Subject:** Proposed Changes to Mapping File  

Dear Weronika,  

We are proposing additional changes to the mapping file, as outlined below:  

- **SUBRISK_TYPE2 Column**: This column determines the type of loss given a scenario and position.  
- **Reporting Adjustments**:  
  - Expected at Risk (EaR) will now be calculated as the 95th percentile of losses where `SUBRISK_TYPE2 == Market`.  
  - Risk-Based Capital (RBC) will be calculated as the 99th percentile of aggregate losses, summing losses where `SUBRISK_TYPE2 == Market` and `SUBRISK_TYPE2 == Liquidity`.  
- **RISK_METRIC Column Update**:  
  - `EaR` will be assigned where `SUBRISK_TYPE2 == Market`.  
  - `RBC` will be assigned where `SUBRISK_TYPE2 == Liquidity`.  
- **Rationale**: Liquidity losses are only relevant for RBC since EaR assumes a going concern.  
- **Additional Columns**: We have included position-specific attributes in the mapping file, primarily for dashboarding on the Insights App.  

Please find attached:  
1. The proposed mapping file with the changes.  
2. The original mapping file currently in production.  

**Actions Requested:**  
1. Let us know if anything is unclear or if you have additional questions.  
2. Confirm whether the schema and aggregation logic outlined above align with downstream processes. (means if this mapping file will not break anything at your end)
3. Confirm if any additional changes are required on our end for aggregation.  (Anything we have missed or that you require to be added or removed)

Looking forward to your feedback.  

Best regards,
