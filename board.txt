Subject: Request to Initiate Addition of New Columns and Approval Process from DGP Team

Hi Satish,

I hope this email finds you well.

I am writing to request your assistance in initiating the process of adding new columns to our current mapping file. To ensure a smooth transition, we need to seek approval from the DGP team for these changes. Below are the details that will guide us through this process:

1. **Existing Columns**: [Please insert the list of existing columns here.]
   
2. **New Set of Columns**: [Please insert the proposed new set of columns here.]

Once we have clarity on the above, we can finalize the updated mapping file which should include:

3. **Final Columns That Should Be Present in the Mapping File**: [Please insert the final list of columns that should be present in the updated mapping file here.]

Could you please take the lead in initiating this process and coordinate with the DGP team for their approval? Your prompt action on this would be greatly appreciated.

Looking forward to your response.

Best regards,  
[Your Name]
