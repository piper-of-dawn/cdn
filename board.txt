Setting Thresholds for Financial Metrics

Determination of Thresholds: To establish the new thresholds, the system utilizes the loss rate associated with the previously established thresholds, specifically Upper/Fair Value (U/FV) and Lower/Fair Value (L/FV).
Calculation of New Thresholds: The new thresholds are calculated by multiplying the established threshold rate by the current Fair Value (FV) values.
