Hi all,

Sorry to barge in unannounced. I want to inform everyone that I have two open positions in my team for the Poland Business Run. 

The current fitness level, running skills or experience do not matter at all. Only thing that matters is your willingness and discipline to improve and be a part of a supportive and motivated group. . We've created a dedicated Strava group where we can track our progress, share tips etc. On the night of the run, I am also thinking to organize a team dinner to celebrate out mutual achievements.

Please DM me directly if you are interested.

Regards,
Kumar Shantanu
