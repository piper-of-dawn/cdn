You are boating through the Mediterranean Sea when your motor breaks down. You remember learning from your divemaster that the probability of seeing at least one boat within a given hour is 73.7856%. Assume that boats are observed as a Poisson process with a fixed rate of observations per time step and that observations are independent in any mutually exclusive time period. What is the probability that you will see at least one boat within the next 10 minutes?
