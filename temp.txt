In this rigorous examination of our regression model, we initially implemented a specification without an intercept term to incorporate the asset beta. However, this approach yielded suboptimal results, as evidenced by a non-zero mean of residuals and a discernible clustering of data points below the regression line. Furthermore, the Durbin-Watson statistic indicated positive autocorrelation among the residuals, raising concerns about the model's validity and predictive power.

The observed anomalies in the residual distribution and autocorrelation structure can be attributed to two primary factors: model misspecification or sampling bias. Given the limited nature of our time series data, comprising only 100 observations, we cannot definitively rule out the possibility of sampling bias influencing our results. Nevertheless, to address the potential model misspecification, we opted to incorporate an intercept term into our regression equation.

Upon inclusion of the intercept term, we observed a marked improvement in the model's performance. The problem of non-zero mean residuals was substantially mitigated, as evidenced by a more balanced distribution of residuals around the regression line. Additionally, the Durbin-Watson statistic showed a notable improvement, suggesting a reduction in the degree of autocorrelation present in the residuals.

This empirical investigation underscores the importance of careful model specification and the potential impact of omitted variables, such as the intercept term, on regression results. While we cannot entirely eliminate the possibility of sampling bias due to the limited dataset, the incorporation of the intercept term has demonstrably enhanced the model's statistical properties and adherence to key regression assumptions.
