This memo examines the methodological considerations and empirical challenges in estimating beta for a structured product, with a particular focus on the implications of model specification.
We investigate two regression models for beta estimation: one including an intercept term and another constraining the intercept to zero. Our analysis reveals that the omission of the intercept results in residuals with non-zero mean and exhibits evidence of positive autocorrelation, as indicated by the Durbin-Watson statistic. Consequently, we propose the adoption of the beta estimate derived from the model incorporating the intercept.
The statistical significance of the intercept term in our preferred model, while deviating from the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) assumptions, is consistent with the observed non-zero mean of residuals in the constrained model. We posit that this departure from theoretical expectations may be attributable to sampling variability, given the relatively small sample size of approximately 40 return observations.
The memo is organized as follows: Section I delineates the beta estimation methodology; Section II presents a comprehensive model diagnostics; Section III assesses the impact of model choice on beta estimates; and Section IV concludes with the final proposal.
